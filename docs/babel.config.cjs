/**
 * Minimal Babel config.
 *
 * This project is built with Vite + `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
 * Vite already handles TS/JSX transforms, so we intentionally keep this file
 * empty-ish to avoid requiring Babel presets that are not installed.
 *
 * Having this file is useful for tooling that expects a Babel config to exist
 * (future tests, codemods, editor integrations, etc.).
